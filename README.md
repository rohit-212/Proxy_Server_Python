The script is cross platform since the modules imported are cross-platform i.e available in both windows python and linux python.

In computer networks, A proxy server is a server ( A computer system or
an application ) that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients
seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy
server, requesting some service, such as a file, connection, web page,
or other resource available from a different server and the proxy server
evaluates the request as a way to simplify and control its complexity.

Proxies were invented to add structure and encapsulation to distributed
systems. Today, most proxies are web proxies, facilitating access to
content on the World Wide Web and providing anonymity.
